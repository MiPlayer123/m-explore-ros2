How Coverage % is Calculated
Formula: Coverage = (Known Cells / Bounding Box Area) × 100
The calculation works as follows:

The system counts all map cells that aren't marked as "unknown" (value -1)
It finds the smallest rectangle that contains all known cells (the bounding box)
Coverage is the percentage of the bounding box that has been explored


- Why Coverage Decreases Over Time
The Bounding Box Problem:
The coverage percentage can drop because the numerator and denominator change at different rates:

Known cells (numerator) increase gradually as robots explore
Bounding box area (denominator) can jump instantly when distant areas are discovered

Key Scenarios That Cause Drops:
Discovery of distant frontiers:

A robot detects an unexplored area far away
The bounding box instantly expands to include this new point
Known cell count hasn't increased yet
Result: Same numerator, much larger denominator = lower percentage

Multi-robot separation:

Two robots explore in opposite directions
Bounding box must span the distance between them
Large unexplored gap exists in the middle
The gap area is included in the bounding box but counts as unexplored

Environment size realization:

Early exploration shows small local area with high coverage
Later discovery reveals the environment is much larger
Bounding box expands dramatically
Coverage drops until robots fill in the new areas

DQN Stage 4 specific issues:

Very large open arena with few obstacles
Robots quickly discover the far edges
Huge bounding box created early
Takes long time to fill the empty space


- Why This is Normal
The drops are calculation artifacts, not actual knowledge loss:

Robots never "forget" explored areas
Absolute count of known cells always increases
The percentage drops because the estimate of "total explorable area" increases
Coverage eventually recovers as robots fill in the gaps
This behavior is more pronounced in multi-robot systems due to robot separation
